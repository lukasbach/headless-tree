# @headless-tree/core

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 7ef4864: added feature where closed items are auto-expanded briefly after dragging onto them. set config option `openOnDropDelay` to zero to disable.

### Patch Changes

- 8d53b4f: fixed a bug where external changes to focused or selected items don't trigger a rerender (#150)
- 1cee368: fixed a bug where the drag line is not cleared after drop (#149)
- 1e833bb: drag-and-drop feature is no longer dependent on selection feature, and fill default to focused item if selection feature is missing (#143)

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 21d1679: add `canDragForeignDragObjectOver` to allow customizing whether a draggable visualization should be shown when dragging foreign data. This allows differentiating logic between drag-over and drop (via the existing `canDropForeignDataObject`), since for the latter `dataTransfer.getData` is not available by default in browsers.

### Patch Changes

- e8ddbb0: Added `item.updateCachedData(data)` in async tree feature, that works similar to the existing `item.updateCachedChildrenIds(childrenIds)` feature
- 662e2a8: Added stories and documentation on how to use nested DOM rendering for tree structures instead of flat lists,
  which can be used for animating expand/collapse behavior
- b41e1d2: fixed a bug where ending drag without successful drop doesn't properly reset drag line (#132)
- b413f74: Fix `aria-posinset` and `aria-level` to be 1-based indexing
- a250b3b: Fix a bug where expand from the initial keyboard focus fails when rootItemId is an empty string
- 62867e8: Introduced a short delay before hiding the drag line when leaving a drag target, which helps to reduce flickering of the dragline when moving between items
- c4579eb: Update keyboard drag and drop to include the focused item in the dragged items
- 662e2a8: Improved customizability of checkboxes feature (still alpha state), allowing you to customize `propagateCheckedState` and `canCheckFolders` independently
- 662e2a8: Changed to new buildtool in core packages (now using tsup) to hopefully fix some ESM/CJS integrations

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 344011a: fixed an issue where dropping items on an empty tree didn't trigger any events
- 9f418f8: support setting the drag preview with the `setDragImage` option (#115)
- 309feba: fixed an issue where the drag-forbidden cursor is shown briefly between changing drag targets (#114)

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 647a072: Fixed incorrect package.json exports configurations to proper ESM and CJS exports (#104)
- 349d36e: change package.json["module"] to commonjs to fix inconsistent package definitiuons (#104)
- e2faf37: Fixed an issue async data loaders that resolve data before the tree is mounted can cause the tree to not render at all

  Note: When using the `createTree()` API directly instead of going through the React `useTree` API, an additional call
  to `tree.rebuildItems()` afterwards will be necessary. This change is marked as minor release regardless, since `createTree` is
  currently not a publically documented feature.

### Patch Changes

- 727c982: export makeStateUpdater from core package
- c041a3f: expose `isOrderedDragTarget` as utility method to differentiate between ordered and unordered drag targets (#108)
- 2887b0c: Added a `item.getKey()` utility method to use for generating React keys. For now, this just returns the item id, so no migration is needed from using `item.getId()` as React keys.
- 4e79bc7: Fixed a bug where `feature.overwrites` is not always respected when features are sorted during tree initialization
- 0669580: Fixed a bug where items that call `item.getProps` while being renamed, can be dragged while being renamed (#110)

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 64d8e2a: add getChildrenWithData method to data loader to support fetching all children of an item at once
- 35260e3: fixed hotkey issues where releasing modifier keys (like shift) before normal keys can cause issues with subsequent keydown events

### Patch Changes

- 29b2c64: improved key-handling behavior for hotkeys while input elements are focused (#98)
- da1e757: fixed a bug where alt-tabbing out of browser will break hotkeys feature
- c283f52: add feature to allow async data invalidation without triggering rerenders with `invalidateItemData(optimistic: true)` (#95)
- 29b2c64: added option to completely ignore hotkey events while input elements are focused (`ignoreHotkeysOnInput`) (#98)
- cd5b27c: add position:absolute to default styles of getDragLineStyle()

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- c9f9932: fixed tree.focusNextItem() and tree.focusPreviousItem() throwing if no item is currently focused
- 6ed84b4: recursive item references are filtered out when rendering (#89)
- 4bef2f2: fixed a bug where hotkeys involving shift may not work properly depending on the order of shift and other key inputs (#98)

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e5027b: The propMemoization feature now memoizes all prop-generation related functions, including searchinput and renameinput related props
