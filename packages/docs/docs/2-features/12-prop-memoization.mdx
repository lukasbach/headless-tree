By default, React props generated by `tree.getContainerProps()` and `item.getProps()` will not
be memoized, and might change their reference during each render as they are generated fresh
each time.

If you rely on stable props, or need them to be memoized, you can simply include the `propMemoizationFeature`
and the props will be memoized automatically. The feature doesn't require any configuration or expose any
methods.

## Example

Consider this sample, where the render method of each item is intentionally slowed down, resulting
in a slow usage experience when expanding or collapsing items:

<DemoBox tags={["feature/propmemoization"]} initialStory="react-guides-render-performance-slow-item-renderers--slow-item-renderers" />

Here, the render method is memoized and the propMemoizationFeature is included. Tree items still
render slowly during the initial render, but items that are unchanged during rerender do not retrigger
the slow render function, resulting in a faster experience when expanding or collapsing items:

<DemoBox tags={["feature/propmemoization"]} initialStory="react-guides-render-performance-memoized-slow-item-renderers--memoized-slow-item-renderers" />
