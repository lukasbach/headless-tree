:::warning

The checkboxes feature was not released on the `latest` channel yet. You can try it out in a snapshot
version with `npm i @headless-tree/core@snapshot` or `npm i @headless-tree/react@snapshot`.

:::

The checkboxes feature allows users to multi-select items in a more permanent way than the normal
selection feature, and visualize that state with checkboxes.

To use the feature, add the `checkboxesFeature` to your feature array and render a checkbox component
in each of your tree item renderers with `<input type="checkbox" {...item.getCheckboxProps()} />`.

As with other tree states, you can manage the checkbox state yourself with the config variable `checkedItems`
and the state change handler `setCheckedItems`, or let Headless Tree manage this state for your.

## `canCheckFolders`

You can configure the behavior of clicking the checkbox on folders with the `canCheckFolders` option. If it is enabled,
checking an folder will only check the folder itself, not its children, and add the id of the folder to the
`checkedItems`. If it is disabled, checking a folder will check all of its children, and while the checkbox will
receive the `checked` state (or `indeterminate` if afterwards individual children are unchecked), the folder itself
will not be added to the `checkedItems`, only its leafs.

:::warning

Trees with `canCheckFolders=false` is currently only supported for synchronous trees, not trees using the Async
Data Loader feature.

:::

The default for `canCheckFolders` is `true` for asynchronous trees, and `false` for synchronous trees.
