## Accessibility according to W3 Specs

Headless Tree follows accessibility guidelines defined by W3 in the [Navigation Treeview Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/examples/treeview-navigation/#support-notice-header),
specificially, the [Treeview with declared properties](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/examples/treeview-1b/).

All relevant aria attributes are provided to the tree and its items automatically.

## Hotkeys

Headless Tree comes with various hotkeys that make using it easier when relying on keyboard
interactions. Hotkeys are enabled if the [Hotkeys Feature](/features/hotkeys) is included in the tree configuration,
and can be configured as described in the [Hotkeys Guide](/guides/hotkeys).

The hotkeys are based on the [W3C recommendations on accessible trees](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/examples/treeview-navigation/#support-notice-header),
and can be customized to fit your needs.

## Keyboard-controlled Drag and Drop

To support moving items via drag-and-drop while staying compliant with accessibility standards, Headless Tree
supports keyboard-controlled drag-and-drop via the [Keyboard Drag and Drop Feature](/features/kdnd).
