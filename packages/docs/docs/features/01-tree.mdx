<!-- TODO add sample with primary action, focus, and expanding -->

The tree core feature is always included by Headless Tree, and does not need to be explicitly imported and
added to your tree config. It provides basic tree-related features, like expanding or collapsing items and moving
the focus. Its state is composed of a list of expanded items, and the ID of the currently focused item.

## Retrieving React Props

Part of what this feature provides is also the default props for both the tree container element, and each
of the tree items. You can retrieve these props by calling `tree.getContainerProps()` or `item.getProps()`.
These props are meant to be spread into the respective elements in your render function, and will provide both
the necessary event handlers and ARIA attributes to make the tree accessible.

Note that both will also provide a `ref` property, which will register a reference to the respective element
to Headless Tree. Alternatively, you can also manually register or deregister elements with `tree.registerElement(el)`
and `item.registerElement(el)`.

```jsx
<div {...tree.getContainerProps()} className="tree">
  {tree.getItems().map((item) => (
    <button
      {...item.getProps()}
      key={item.getId()}
      style={{ paddingLeft: `${item.getItemMeta().level * 20}px` }}
    >
      {item.getItemName()}
    </button>
  ))}
</div>
```

## Primary action

Headless Tree exposes a concept called "primary action", which is invoked when the user clicks on an item
with the intent to perform an action on that item. A handler `onPrimaryAction` can be provided in the tree
configuration. By default it will be clicked when the user clicks on an item, or when `item.primaryAction()`
is invoked programmatically.

By customizing the implementation of `item.getProps().onClick()`, the behavior of calling this function
can be customized.

## Managing the focused item

By default, Headless Tree will maintain the focused item in its internal state. If a `setState` or `setFocusedItem`
function is provided in the tree configuration, you can manage the focused item yourself (see [Managing State](/guides/state)).

You can also use the `item.setFocused()` method to focus an item programmatically. You likely want to follow
this up with a call to `tree.updateDomFocus()` to update the focused item in DOM and scroll to that item.

## Expanding and collapsing folders

Similarly to the focused item, Headless Tree will maintain the list of expanded items in its internal state.
Provide a `setExpandedItems` function in the tree configuration to manage the expanded items yourself, otherwise
Headless Tree will manage the expanded items for you (see [Managing State](/guides/state)). Call `item.expand()`
or `item.collapse()` to expand or collapse an item, or `item.isExpanded()` to check if an item is expanded.
