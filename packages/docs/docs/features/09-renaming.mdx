The renaming feature allows you to allow users to rename items in the tree. They can either start renaming
an item via the `renameItem` hotkey (defaulting to F2), or when the `item.startRenaming()` method is called.
You can hook this up to e.g. double-clicking an item-name or to a context menu option.

The feature exposes two state variables, `renamingItem` to keep track of the item that is currently being renamed,
and `renamingValue` to keep track of the new name that the user is typing in. When
[maintaining individual states](/guides/state#managing-individual-feature-states), you can hook into changes to
those states via the `setRenamingItem` and `setRenamingValue` config methods.

## Rendering the Rename Input

Similar to other Headless Tree Features, the library only provides the functionality, but not the UI. For any tree
item, you can determine whether it should render a renaming behavior with `item.isRenaming()`. Make sure to
pass `item.getRenameInputProps()` to the input element to hook up the renaming behavior to the input field.

```jsx
if (item.isRenaming()) {
  return (
    <input {...item.getRenameInputProps()} />
  );
}

// otherwise, render the item as usual
```

## Customizing which items can be renamed

You can also customize which items can be renamed by providing a `canRename` function in the tree configuration.
