The Hotkeys Core feature is necessary for any keyboard-based interaction via hotkeys to work.
Each of the features define their own hotkeys configurations (e.g. the Selection Feature provides the `selectAll` hotkey
defaulting to `Ctrl+A`), which can be customized or extended in the tree configuration.
However, only the Hotkeys Core feature implements the logic to listen for and handle keyboard events, and
is necessary for any hotkeys of other features to work.

The feature also makes it very easy to add custom hotkeys with arbitrary keybindings and implementations.

Look into the [Guide on Hotkeys](/guides/hotkeys) for details on how to use the Hotkeys Core Feature, and how to
overwrite or add custom hotkeys.

The [Accessibility Guide](/guides/accessibility#hotkeys) shows some demos of which hotkeys are available and how they can be used.
