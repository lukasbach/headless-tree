The Search feature provides the functionality for users to quickly find a certain item by typing
a part of its name. This fulfills the accessibility feature of a typeahead search, and is particularly
useful in large trees where the user might not be able to find the item they are looking for by
scrolling through the tree, while also making its use a bit more obvious by showing the search
input field. This is consistent with similar tree implementations such as the file tree in JetBrains IDEs,
where typing in the tree will show a search input field.

The items will not be shown in a filtered view, but instead search matches will be visually highlighted,
the tree will be scrolled and focused to the first search match, and navigating through the items with
up or down arrow keys will move the focus only between matched items.

The search input field will automatically be opened when the user starts typing while focusing the tree,
but it can also be opened programmatically by calling `tree.openSearch()`. Blurring the input field, pressing
Escape (if the Hotkeys Core Feature is included), or invoking `tree.closeSearch()` will close the search.
`tree.isSearchOpen()` can be used to check if the search input field is currently open and should be rendered.

Similar to the remaining tree integration, it is up to the library consumer to render the search input field
correctly. Pass `tree.getSearchInputElementProps()` as props to the search input to hook it up with change
handlers and register its element with Headless Tree.

```jsx
{tree.isSearchOpen() && (
  <>
    <input {...tree.getSearchInputElementProps()} />
    ({tree.getSearchMatchingItems().length} matches)
  </>
)}
```

Then, use `item.isMatchingSearch()` to determine if an item is currently a search match, and style it accordingly.
