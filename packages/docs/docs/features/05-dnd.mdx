The Drag-And-Drop Feature provides drag-and-drop capabilities. It allows to drag a single tree item (or many of the
[selection feature](/features/selection) is included in the tree config) and drop it somewhere else in the tree.
The feature also allows you to create interactions between the tree and external drag objects, allowing you to drag
tree items out of the tree, or foreign data objects from outside the tree inside. As extension of that, this can
also be used to implement drag behavior between several trees.

Since this feature composes a large part of the functionality of Headless Tree, it is documented in its own section
"Drag and Drop" on the left, get started with the [Drag and Drop Overview Page](/dnd/overview).
