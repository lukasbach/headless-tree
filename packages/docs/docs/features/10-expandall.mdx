The expand-all feature exposes methods both on any item instance and the tree instance to expand or collapse
all of its items. When called on the tree instance, it will expand or collapse all items in the tree, otherwise
it will only affect all children of the item.

When used in conjunction with the [async data loader](/features/async-dataloader), the expand-all feature will
wait for children to load in during each step, before triggering the expanding of the next level. You can also
programmatically abort the expanding process at any time when this happens. When calling the `expandAll` method,
you can pass an object with a `current` variable. Setting this to `false` during the expanding progress will
cancel the expanding process while it is happening.

```ts
const cancelToken = { current: false };

const expand = () => {
  cancelToken.current = false;
  tree.expandAll(cancelToken);
};
const cancelExpanding = () => {
  cancelToken.current = true;
};
```
