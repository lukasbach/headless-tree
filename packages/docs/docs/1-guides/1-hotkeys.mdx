Headless Tree provides its own implementation of keybindings that can be customized and extended.

Further down on this page, you can find a list of all available hotkeys. Note that the availability of hotkeys
depends on the features that are included. For any hotkey to work, the `hotkeysCoreFeature` must be included.
This enables some basic tree-related hotkeys like moving focus with arrow keys. Other feature-specific hotkeys,
like toggling selection or renaming an item, need both the `hotkeysCoreFeature` and the feature that implements
the functionality, such as the `selectionFeature` or the `renamingFeature`.

The type of a hotkey implementation is shown below. Read on to see how you can customize existing hotkeys with this
type or add your own.

```ts
export interface HotkeyConfig<T> {
  hotkey: string;
  canRepeat?: boolean;
  allowWhenInputFocused?: boolean;
  isEnabled?: (tree: TreeInstance<T>) => boolean;
  preventDefault?: boolean;
  handler: (e: KeyboardEvent, tree: TreeInstance<T>) => void;
}
```

## Overwriting Hotkeys

You can pass an object of partial hotkey implementations in the `hotkeys` config property to your tree.
Default hotkeys and your custom hotkeys will be merged together during runtime, with your custom hotkeys
overwriting the default hotkeys. This allows you to overwrite the keybindings, parts of the behavior (like
being able to repeat pressing the key) certain hotkeys or overwriting their implementation.

Use the tables at the bottom of the page for reference of the hotkey names.

## Adding custom Hotkeys

You can also very easily add custom hotkeys, with arbitrary keybindings and implementations. While you can
technically use any names for the hotkeys, the TypeScript type is implemented to only support the official
hotkey names and any names that are prefixed with `custom` to avoid mistakes.

<DemoBox stories={["react-hotkeys-custom-hotkeys--custom-hotkeys"]} />

The names of keys are based on the [HTML Key value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_key_values).
The following additional key names are supported:

- `LetterOrNumber`: Any letter or number key, `/^[a-z0-9]$/`
- `Letter`: Any letter key, `/^[a-z]$/`
- `Plus`: The symbol plus, `/^\+$/`. Useful since the "+" symbol is used in keybinding strings to concatenate individual keys.

## Available Hotkeys

The [Accessibility Guide](/guides/accessibility#hotkeys) shows some demos of which hotkeys are available and how they can be used.
